## How to Install and Run the Project

### Run Jupyter Notebooks with Docker Container

Step 1. Install Docker

Use the link below to install Docker according to your operating system.

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

Step 2. Clone the Git Repository to your local machine

```sh
https://github.com/layaniw/hands-on-jupyter.git
```

Step 3. Run the notebooks

Start Docker and navigate to the directory where the Dockerfile from this repository is stored. Open a command prompt and run

```sh
docker-compose up
```

This will build the docker image and run the container. You will see URLs at the end when everything is finished running in the terminal. If you are not navigated to one of those URLs automatically, you can copy-paste one of those URLs into a browser and open jupyter notebooks from there.

### Run Jupyter Notebooks using Anaconda

Step 1. Install Anaconda

Install the Anaconda distribution of Python. Download Anaconda at the following link

https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html

Step 2. Clone the Git Repository to your local machine

```sh
https://github.com/layaniw/hands-on-jupyter.git
```

Step 3. Go to the Windows start menu and select Anaconda Prompt

Step 4. Run jupyter notebook

At the Anaconda Prompt navigate to the folder with jupyter notebooks and type:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

This command will start the Jupyter notebook server. The output in the Anaconda Prompt will include an URL. If you are not navigated to that URL automatically, you can copy-paste the URL from the Anaconda Prompt and paste it into a web browser. You can open Jupiter notebooks from there.
